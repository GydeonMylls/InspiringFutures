## Introduction
Inspiring Futures is an app developed with the [Institute of Criminology](http://www.crim.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge. The app allows users to submit daily answers, including photos, to a series of questions.

## Tutorial

### Setup
The first screen a user encounters after installing the app is the course selection screen. Here the must pick the course the are participating in and enter it's password to continue (see server documentation for how to set these). Without participating in a course the app cannot be used.

### Questionnaires
Once the user has selected their course they will be shown the course's daily questionnaire when they open the app. They can navigate through the questionnaire using the `Next` and `Back` buttons. By default the user may choose not to answer any or all questions. However, questions may be set as compulsory, see the server documentation for details.

### Reminders
The user is is sent a notification every day at approximately 3pm to remind them to respond that day. They may of course choose to ignore this.

### Data synchronisation
The user's responses are securely sent to the server every day at approximately noon, if the user is connected to WiFi.
