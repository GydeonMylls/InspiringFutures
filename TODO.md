# To Do
(Roughly ordered by priority)

* [ ] Fix file upload method
* [ ] Expand ESM_AudioVideo to include audio and video (unsurprisingly)
* [ ] Settings
    * [ ] Show device ID
    * [ ] Reminder time
    * [ ] Delete data
    * [ ] Contact
    * [ ] Licence
* [ ] Allow pushing questionnaires down to device - using MQTT?
    * [ ] One-time questionnaires
    * [ ] Changes to daily questionnaire
* [ ] Fix Other option behaviour in ESM_Radios (doesn't forget custom entry when unselected in certain ways)
* [ ] Support screen rotation

More technical tasks to be done are in comments in code (most IDEs should be able to find them)
