# To Do
(Loosely ordered by priority)

* Expand ESM_AudioVideo to include audio and video (unsurprisingly)
* Settings
    * Show device ID
    * Reminder time
    * Delete data
    * Contact
    * Licence
* Allow pushing questionnaires down to device - using MQTT?
    * One-time questionnaires
    * Changes to daily questionnaire
* Fix Other option behaviour in ESM_Radios
* Support screen rotation
    * Fix buttons
* Different layout for tablets
    * All questions on one scrollable page?

More technical tasks to be done are in comments in code (most IDEs should be able to find them)
